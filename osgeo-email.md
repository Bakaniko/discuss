# Application to become an OSGeo Community

Dear OSGeo Incubation Committee,

We would like to apply, as the 'R-Spatial' community, to become an OSGeo affiliated organisation.

We are a diverse group with a shared interest in developing free and open tools for the reproducible analysis of geographic data. R is a popular and rapidly growing language for statistical computing and 'data science'. It is already part of OSGeo ecosystem: R ships with the OSGeo Live distribution, integrates with established OSGeo projects such as [GRASS GIS](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/R_statistics), and (now slightly dated) tutorials listed on OSGeo's [old website](http://old.www.osgeo.org/educational_content).

After a discussion on our GitHub Organisation at [github.com/r-spatial](https://github.com/r-spatial), it is clear that closer links could be mutually beneficial. Collaboration is at the heart of open source software and the R community has a long history. The history of R-GRASS GIS bridges, for example, covers more than [20 years](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0098-3004(00)00057-1) and goes in both directions. R interfaces enable a wide range of people to access OSGeo-supported software from a reproducible command-line interface. 

Continued development and innovation in R-OSGeo links are illustrated the [qgisprocess](https://github.com/paleolimbot/qgisprocess) package, which motivated positive changes in the QGIS source code (see [github.com/paleolimbot/qgisprocess/issues/21](https://github.com/paleolimbot/qgisprocess/issues/21)). The R-Spatial community relies on the OSGeo projects GDAL, PROJ and GEOS for data access and geographic operations. Core R-Spatial packages `sf`, `raster` and `terra` use bindings to the libraries for much of the heavy lifting and many thousands of people using R for spatial research (often without knowing) run OSGeo support code every day. We would like to support the ongoing work of these vital components of the wider community that is represented by the OSGeo-affiliated conference series FOSS4G. We also anticipate benefits from being part of the wider OSGeo community and would like to be more active members of wider movement advocating free and open source software for geospatial.

'R-Spatial' can be loosely defined as the ecosystem of code, projects and people using R for working with and adding value to spatial data. A manifestation of the wider R-Spatial community is the friendly, vibrant and diverse range of voices using the [#rspatial](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rspatial) tag on Twitter. For the purposes of OSGeo supported *software* projects however, we define R-Spatial packages as those that can be found on at https://github.com/rspatial/ (which includes key packages `raster` and `terra`) and https://github.com/r-spatial/ (which includes `sf`, `stars` and many other popular packages for working with spatial data).

Specifically, we would like to initiate the three-step process needed to become a full OSGeo project, as outlined on the [Incubation Committee web page](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Incubation_Committee#Step_1:_Add_OSGeo_Website_Project_Page):

- We would like to create an OSGeo web page with information about key packages in the 'R-spatial stack', including how they relate to OSGeo projects
- We would like to become an [OSGeo Community Project](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Incubation_Committee#Step_2:_Join_Community_Projects_Program)
- We would like to enter the [incubation program](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Incubation_Committee#Incubator) with a view to eventually becoming a full community project

All the best,

R-Spatial developers:
